Randin (Random Input)
=====================
Can really be used for any sort of randomized keyboard input.
I personally have been using this script as my password generator.

What is this mess?
------------------
My first dabble in Ruby and first upload to the hub.

Examples
--------
1. `ruby randin.rb` or `./randin.rb` :: default 10 character, ascii output
2. `ruby randin.rb -s 25 -v 3 -t alphanumeric` :: 3 sets of 25 characters, no symbols
3. `ruby randin.rb -h` :: usage

PwStrength.entropy, what?
-------------------------
Ya I know =). It was a comparison to [this xkcd][xkcd], early placeholder function really.
